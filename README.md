# Impact Framework - Plugins for Estimating Carbon Emissions of Webpages

## Plugins

- Measure Webpage
- Green Hosting Check
- Timer

The Measure Webpage plugin can measure the page weight of a webpage. It can also estimate the `dataReloadRatio` needed for the [Sustainable Webdesign Model](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/) provided by the co2js plugin.

The Green Hosting Check plugin can check if a website is hosted green by querying the [database of the Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/green-web-dataset/).

The Timer plugin is more generic. It can provide an accurate timestamp and duration for a measurement.
